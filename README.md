# AntiFirmament

*because privacy matters*

This mod attempts to block the [ModAnnouncer](https://github.com/FirmamentMC/Firmament/blob/mc-1.21.11/src/main/kotlin/features/misc/ModAnnouncer.kt) packet the mod [Firmament](https://modrinth.com/mod/firmament) attempts to send while joining servers.

This is NOT normal Fabric behavior - as only Forge has a mod announcer built in, and personally I don't see a need for one to exist in Fabric. No server is required to see my mod's folder (MOD IDs) and no singular mod should be sending this information out without prior consent/knowledge.

I (Axle) and AntiFirmament do not intend to cause any tarnishment to the reputation of FirmamentMC and the creator of the logo - it's simply an easy way to convey "hey this blocks *something* of Firmament" meow~
